# NAME

keyringer - encrypted and distributed secret sharing software

# SYNOPSIS

keyringer <*keyring*> <*action*> [*options*]...

# DESCRIPTION

Keyringer lets you manage and share secrets using GPG and git with custom
commands to encrypt, decrypt, recrypt, create key pairs, etc.

Secrets are encrypted using GPG and added to a git tree so later then can
be synced with remote branches.

# ACTIONS

Keyringer has three types of actions:

1. Repository lookup and manipulation actions.
2. Secret manipulation actions.
3. Configuration actions.

## REPOSITORY LOOKUP AND MANIPULATION ACTIONS

init <*path*> [*remote*]
:  Initialize a new keyringer repository. If a *remote* URL is specified, keyringer will
   clone an existing repository.

   After initialization, *path* will contain a folder structure for storing secrets
   and metadata (user aka recipients, groups of recipients, etc).

   Also, an entry on `$HOME/.keyringer/config` will be added allowing keyringer to
   find the keyring by it's alias.

git <*action*> <*options*>
:  Git wrapper that operates from the toplevel keyring repository. You can issue any
   *GIT(1)* subcommand with this action that it will be applied into the keyring repository.

ls <*path*>
:  List contents from the toplevel repository *keys* folder or from relative paths
   if *path* is specified. Like the git wrapper, this is a wrapper around the *LS(1)*
   command.

## SECRET MANIPULATION ACTIONS

All secret manipulation actions operates upon a *secret* which is the pathname
of an encrypted file relative to keyring with optional `.asc` extension.

If the `.asc` extension is ommited, keyringer will add it in the end of the
pathname.

Secret manipulation actions do not commit changes into the secret repository.
After any manipulation, the user has to manually commit the changes using the
git wrapper action.

append <*secret*>
:  Append contents into a secret.

append-batch <*secret*>
:  Append contents into a secret, batch mode.

decrypt <*secret*>
:  Decrypts a secret into standard output.

del <*secret*>
:  Removes a secret using git. After deleting a secret a git commit and push is still
   needed to update remote repositories. To completely remove a file from a keyring,
   you should also rewrite the git history by yourself.

edit <*secret*>
:  Edits a secret by temporarily decrypting it, opening the decrypted copy into *$EDITOR*
   and then recrypting it again.

encrypt [*file*] <*secret*>
:  Encrypts content from standard input or *file* into *secret*.

encrypt-batch <*secret*>
:  Encrypt content, batch mode.

genpair <*ssh*|*gpg*|*ssl*|*ssl-self*> [*options*]
:  Wrapper to generete encryption keypairs, useful for automated key deployment.

open <*secret*>
:  Open a secret using xdg-open.

recrypt <*secret*>
:  Recrypts a secret by decrypting it and recrypting again. Useful when users are added
   into recipient configuration. If no *secret* is given, all secrets in the repository
   are re-encrypted.

## CONFIGURATION ACTIONS

commands
:  List available actions, useful for shell completion and syntax check.

options <*ls*|*edit*|*add*>
:  List, edit or add miscelaneous *repository options*.

preferences <*ls*|*edit*|*add*>
:  List, edit or add *user options* for a given repository.

recipients <*ls*|*edit*> <*recipient-file*>
:  List or edit recipient configuration.

usage
:  Show usage information.

# FILES

$HOME/.keyringer/config
: User's main configuration file used to map alias names to keyrings.

$HOME/.keyringer/*keyring*
: User preferences for the keyringer aliased *keyring*.

$KEYRING_FOLDER/config/options
: Custom keyring options which will be applied for all users that use
  the keyringer repository.
